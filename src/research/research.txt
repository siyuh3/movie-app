Movie Hub
Movie search engines and movie review platforms provide rich movie resources and reviews to users, however, limited user
interaction functionalities enabled by the platforms makes it hard to keep users more engaged and maintain user
retention rate. Moreover, due to lack of high-quality movie review articles composed by professional critics,
users might not be able to get decent and thorough feedback of movies from the platforms. Our project, Movie Hub aims to
solve these existing problems.
